        Garden Story is a social sim and adventure RPG where you play Concord, a newly appointed village guardian. There’s lots to keep this helpful adventurer busy; not only do your neighbors need assistance, but a mysterious Rot has seeped into the foundations of the once flourishing island! Fortunately, Concord won’t be working at this alone. 
        Help your friends with their struggles, and they’ll help you through yours. Balance caring for the environment, exploring new regions, and fostering new friendships as you solve puzzles and help restore the Grove to glory!
